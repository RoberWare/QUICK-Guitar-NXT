**Building

https://github.com/RoberWare/QUICK-Guitar-NXT/blob/Imgs/brick.png

Motor set at port A and the button at port 4.

**MODIFY THE PROGRAM

Just like you want it! 

**Installation

It hasn't got, just execute 
<code>
python main.py
</code>

**Problems connecting the brick?

-Bluetooth
If you have problems pairing the brick maybe you have to pair the brick with your computer before running the program.
Just open the Bluetooth settings and pair with nxt, you'll need to write the same verification code in the brick.

-Usb
If you can't connect the brick using bluetooth try to connect the brick by usb to the computer.
If it doesn't work try to change the usb port.

-Anything works?
Try to turn on the nxt, have you got batteries?
